## JOINS

Imagine you have a customers table and orders table. We can use joins to link the data together.

`Customers`:

| id | name      |
|---|------------|
| 1 | John Smith |
| 2 | Jane Smith |
| 3 | Joe Bloggs |

`Orders`:

| id | order_date | amount | customer_id |
|---|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | 01/01/2020  | 100    | 1           |
| 2 | 01/02/2020  | 200    | 3           |
| 3 | 01/03/2020  | 400    | 4           |
| 4 | 01/04/2020  | 500    | 5           |

### INNER JOIN

This will get a list of customers who placed an order:

```sql
select `name`, order_date, amount
from customers c
inner join orders o
on c.id = o.customer_id
```

| name       | order_date | amount |
|------------|------------|--------|
| John Smith | 01/01/2020 | 100    |
| Joe Bloggs | 01/02/2020 | 200    |

### LEFT JOIN

This left join will append information about orders on the customers table, regardless of whether a customer placed an order or not.

```sql
select `name`, order_date, amount
from customers c
left join orders o
on c.id = o.customer_id
```

| name       | order_date | amount  |
|------------|------------|---------|
| John Smith | 01/01/2020 | 100     |
| Jane Smith | NULL       | NULL    |
| Joe Bloggs | 01/02/2020 | 200     |

### RIGHT JOIN

This is a mirror of the left join on the previous slide which will get all orders, appended with customer information.

```sql
select `name`, order_date, amount
from customers c
right join orders o
on c.id = o.customer_id
```

| name       | order_date | amount  |
|------------|------------|---------|
| John Smith | 01/01/2020 | 100     |
| Joe Bloggs | 01/02/2020 | 200     |
| NULL       | 01/02/2020 | 400     |
| NULL       | 01/02/2020 | 500     |

### FULL OUTER JOIN

A list of all records from both tables. MySQL has no concept of a full outer join so we have to play a trick here.

```sql
select `name`, order_date, amount
from
  orders o left join customers c
  on o.customer_id = c.id

union all -- don't remove duplicates

select `name`, order_date, amount
from
  orders o right join customers c
  on o.customer_id = c.id
```
