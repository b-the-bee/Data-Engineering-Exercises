# Create an API in python (Optional stretch exercise)

## Setting up Flask

FYI - On Windows you will need a GitBash terminal or to use WSL2.

### Create a venv

```sh
# Mac/Unix
$ python3 -m venv .venv
# or on Windows
$ py -m venv .venv
```

### Activate venv

Unix/MacOS:

```sh
# activate the virtual environment
$ source .venv/bin/activate
# deactivate the virtual environment (for after you are done)
$ deactivate
```

Windows:

```sh
# activate the virtual environment
$ .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# deactivate the virtual environment (for after you are done)
$ deactivate
```

### Install dependencies

Run this to install the dependencies:

```sh
# Mac/Unix
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# or on Windows
$ py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Part 1 Setting up a REST API

1. Make a `hello world` API by flowing the [Flask quick start guide](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/)
    0. Make a file called `hello-world.py` - you will need to add some code to it!
    0. Export it to flask with `export FLASK_APP=hello-world`
    0. Export the env with `export FLASK_ENV=development`
    0. Execute it with `flask run`
2. Call your API from your web browser
3. Play around with your API, make it return something different

## Part 2 Implementing REST API services for a website

This part of the exercise will get you to build the backend serveries (REST APIs) for a cafe website. The website will work as intended if you build the correct APIs. If your API implementation deviates from what the front end is expecting then an error message will be returned.

### Opening the website

1. Save the `RESTful-cafe/rest-ful-cafe.html` file somewhere in your computer
2. Open the HTML file in your browser by double clicking it. You should see a very basic website
    0. You can also do this in VSCode by right-clicking and selecting the "Open in Default Browser" menu option
3. Make sure your API server is running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and try out the website. Note that none of the APIs will work for two reasons, you have not built them yet and your CORS policy is not set up

### Setting up a CORS policy

1. If you open your browser's developer tools you will see an error message to do with CORS like this:

  ```sh
  Access to fetch at 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/order' from origin 'null'
  has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'
  header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response
  serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the
  resource with CORS disabled.
  ```

  CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing) allows you to restrict what websites an API can be used on. This error is caused by not having a CORS policy set up.

1. To set up a CORS policy we must return a header called `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to the browser. This will tell your browser that its safe to communicate with it. You can do this by pasting the code below into your API module.

  ```py
  # After a request is made, add a header called "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" to the response.
  # This will tell the browser that the API can supply data to any URL.
  @app.after_request
  def add_header(response):
      response.headers["Access-Control-Allow-Origin"] = "*"
      return response
  ```

1. After making any changes to your API code to make them take effect you need to restart your server. To restart your server, stop your server with `Ctrl + C` and start it again with `flask run` or `Up-Arrow, Enter`. Then check the CORS error has disappeared

## Implementing the API

### 1. GET Product

Start by implementing the `GET /product` API.
This API should return a list of products that looks like

```py
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Tea",
    "price": 1.2,
    "imageUrl":
    "https://www.twinings.co.uk/app_/responsive/TwiningsUKI/media/content/About-Tea/shutterstock_126275183.jpg?w=1260"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Coffee",
    "price": 3.5,
    "imageUrl":
    "https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTHm0-W876ppWBpCak_UzC9eRz8X5CeI1KPYw&usqp=CAU"
  }
]
```

Note you might have to JSON encode the python object to turn it into a string for the API.

### 2. Get Product Ingredients

Implement the `GET /product/product_id/ingredients` API. This should return a response that looks like this:

```py
[
  { "name": "Rice flower", "content": 20, "isCommonAllergen": True },
  { "name": "Fish", "content": 50, "isCommonAllergen": False },
  { "name": "Egg", "content": 30, "isCommonAllergen": True }
]
```

### 3. Create Order

Implement the `POST /order` API. This should return an integer orderId like:

```py
  { "orderId": "123" }
```

### 4. Challenge calculate the total price of the order

When an order is created the `POST /order` API receives a request which contains a JSON list of objects containing the `productId` and the `quantity`.

Use these to return a `totalPrice` field to the website like:

```py
{
    "orderId": 123,
    "totalPrice": 14.5
}
```

Hint: If you want a hint on getting the request body inside the API then keep reading...
You can get the raw request body like this

```py
from flask import request
request_body = request.data
```

See docs at <https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/api/#flask.Request.data?
